Follow these steps for how to litter train a kitten: \xb7 Show her the boxes as soon as she arrives by setting her in them and letting her sniff and examine them. Be sure not to move the boxes once you've shown them to her, to avoid confusing her. \xb7 Set your cat in one of the boxes immediately following meals and after she wakes up from naps. If you notice her behaving like she needs to go, which might look like sniffing or crouching in a particular area, pick her up and put her in her litter box. \xb7 Reward her whenever you notice her using it. Praise her and give her a treat or a toy. \xb7 Don't punish or scold her for accidents. Doing so will only lead to stress and anxiety, which may exacerbate the problem and make training more difficult. Cats do not associate punishment with the incident in question, so it doesn't help train her not to do it in the future. Cleaning and Maintenance It's important to take proper care of the litter box. Not only will this help eliminate the dreaded \"cat smell\" from your home, but it will also make using the box a more pleasant experience for your cat. \xb7 Scoop the box daily to remove your kitten's deposits.
